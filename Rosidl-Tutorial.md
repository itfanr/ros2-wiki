# Introduction to msg and srv

* msg: msg files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message. They are used to generate source code for messages in different languages.
* srv: an srv file describes a service. It is composed of two parts: a request and a response. The request and response are message declarations.

msgs are just simple text files with a field type and field name per line. The field types you can use are:

* int8, int16, int32, int64 (plus uint*)
* float32, float64
* string
* other msg files
* variable-length array[], fixed-length array[C], bounded-length array[<=C]


Here is an example of a msg that uses a string primitive, and two other msgs:
```
  string child_frame_id
  geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance pose
  geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance twist
```

srv files are just like msg files, except they contain two parts: a request and a response. The two parts are separated by a '---' line. Here is an example of a srv file:

```
float64 A
float64 B
---
float64 Sum
```
In the above example, A and B are the request, and Sum is the response.

msg files are stored in the `msg` directory of a package, and srv files are stored in the `srv` directory.

These are just simple examples.
For more information about how to create msg and srv files please refer to [[About ROS Interfaces]].

# Creating a msg package

**NOTE:** only ament_cmake packages can generate messages currently (not ament_python packages).

For this tutorial we will use the packages stored in the [rosidl_tutorials repository](https://github.com/ros2/tutorials/tree/rosidl_tutorials/rosidl_tutorials)
```
cd ~/ros2_overlway_ws/src
git clone -b rosidl_tutorials https://github.com/ros2/tutorials.git
cd rosidl_tutorials/rosidl_tutorials_msgs
```
## Creating a msg file
Here we will create a message meant to carry information about an individual.

Open `msg/Contact.msg` and you will see:

```
bool FEMALE=true
bool MALE=false

string first_name
string last_name
bool gender
uint8 age
string address
```

This message is composed of 5 fields:
- first_name: of type string
- last_name: of type string
- gender: of type bool, that can be either MALE or FEMALE
- age: of type uint8
- address: of type string

There's one more step, though. We need to make sure that the msg files are turned into source code for C++, Python, and other languages:

Open the `package.xml`, and uncomment these two lines:
```xml
  <buildtool_depend>rosidl_default_generators</buildtool_depend>

  <exec_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</exec_depend>
```

Note that at build time, we need "rosidl_default_generators", while at runtime, we only need "rosidl_default_runtime".

Open the `CMakeLists.txt` and make sure that the following lines are uncommented.

Find the package that generates message code from msg/srv files:
```cmake
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)
```

Declare the list of messages you want to generate:
```cmake
set(msg_files
  "msg/Contact.msg"
)
```

By adding the .msg files manually, we make sure that CMake knows when it has to reconfigure the project after you add other .msg files.

Generate the messages:
```cmake
rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  ${msg_files}
)
```

Also make sure you export the message runtime dependency:
```cmake
ament_export_dependencies(rosidl_default_runtime)
```


Now you're ready to generate source files from your msg definition.

# Creating a srv

We will now add a srv declaration to our package.

Open the srv/AddTwoFloats.srv file and paste this srv declaration:

```
float64 a
float64 b
---
float64 sum

```

Declare the service in the `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
set(srv_files
  "srv/AddTwoFloats.srv")
```

Modify the existing call to rosidl_generate_interfaces to generate the service in addition to the messages:
```cmake
rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  ${msg_files}
  ${srv_files}
)
```

# Using custom messages
## Using msg/srv from other packages
Let's write a C++ node using the Contact.msg we just created.

Go to the rosidl_tutorials package and open the src/publish_contact.cpp file.
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"

#include "rosidl_tutorials_msgs/msg/contact.hpp"


using namespace std::chrono_literals;

class ContactPublisher : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
  ContactPublisher()
  : Node("address_book_publisher")
  {
    contact_publisher_ = this->create_publisher<rosidl_tutorials_msgs::msg::Contact>("contact");

    auto publish_msg = [this]() -> void {
        auto msg = std::make_shared<rosidl_tutorials_msgs::msg::Contact>();

        msg->first_name = "John";
        msg->last_name = "Doe";
        msg->age = 30;
        msg->gender = msg->MALE;
        msg->address = "unknown";

        std::cout << "Publishing Contact\nFirst:" << msg->first_name <<
          "  Last:" << msg->last_name << std::endl;

        contact_publisher_->publish(msg);
      };
    timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(1s, publish_msg);
  }

private:
  rclcpp::Publisher<rosidl_tutorials_msgs::msg::Contact>::SharedPtr contact_publisher_;
  rclcpp::timer::TimerBase::SharedPtr timer_;
};


int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
  rclcpp::init(argc, argv);

  auto publisher_node = std::make_shared<ContactPublisher>();

  rclcpp::spin(publisher_node);

  return 0;
}
```
### The code explained
```c++
#include "rosidl_tutorials_msgs/msg/contact.hpp"
```
Here we include the header of the message that we want to use.

```c++
  ContactPublisher()
  : Node("address_book_publisher")
  {
```
Here we define a node

```c++
auto publish_msg = [this]() -> void {

```
A publish_msg function to send our message periodically

```c++
       auto msg = std::make_shared<rosidl_tutorials_msgs::msg::Contact>();

        msg->first_name = "John";
        msg->last_name = "Doe";
        msg->age = 30;
        msg->gender = msg->MALE;
        msg->address = "unknown";
```
We create a Contact message and populate its fields.

```c++
        std::cout << "Publishing Contact\nFirst:" << msg->first_name <<
          "  Last:" << msg->last_name << std::endl;

        contact_publisher_->publish(msg);
```
Finally we publish it

```c++
    timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(1s, publish_msg);
```
Create a 1second timer to call our `publish_msg` function every second

Now let's build it!

To use this message we need to declare a dependency on rosidl_tutorials_msgs in the `package.xml`:
```xml
  <build_depend>rosidl_tutorials_msgs</build_depend>

  <exec_depend>rosidl_tutorials_msgs</exec_depend>
```

And also in the `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
find_package(rosidl_tutorials_msgs REQUIRED)

```

And finally we must declare the message package as a target dependency for the executable.
```cmake
ament_target_dependencies(publish_contact
  "rclcpp"
  "rosidl_tutorials_msgs"
)
```


## Using msg/srv from the same package
While most of the time messages are declared in interface packages, it can be convenient to declare, create and use messages all in the one package.

We will create a message in our rosidl_tutorials package.
Create a msg directory in the rosidl_tutorials package and AddressBook.msg inside that directory.
In that msg paste:
```
rosidl_tutorials_msgs/Contact[] address_book
```

As you can see we define a message based on the Contact message we created earlier.

To generate this message we need to declare a dependency on this package in the `package.xml`:
```xml
  <build_depend>rosidl_tutorials_msgs</build_depend>

  <exec_depend>rosidl_tutorials_msgs</exec_depend>
```

And in the `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
find_package(rosidl_tutorials_msgs REQUIRED)

set(msg_files
  "msg/AddressBook.msg"
)

rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  ${msg_files}
  DEPENDENCIES rosidl_tutorials_msgs
)
```

Now we can start writing code that uses this message.

Open src/publish_address_book.cpp:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"

#include "rosidl_tutorials/msg/address_book.hpp"
#include "rosidl_tutorials_msgs/msg/contact.hpp"

using namespace std::chrono_literals;

class AddressBookPublisher : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
  AddressBookPublisher()
  : Node("address_book_publisher")
  {
    address_book_publisher_ =
      this->create_publisher<rosidl_tutorials::msg::AddressBook>("address_book");

    auto publish_msg = [this]() -> void {
        auto msg = std::make_shared<rosidl_tutorials::msg::AddressBook>();
        {
          rosidl_tutorials_msgs::msg::Contact contact;
          contact.first_name = "John";
          contact.last_name = "Doe";
          contact.age = 30;
          contact.gender = contact.MALE;
          contact.address = "unknown";
          msg->address_book.push_back(contact);
        }
        {
          rosidl_tutorials_msgs::msg::Contact contact;
          contact.first_name = "Jane";
          contact.last_name = "Doe";
          contact.age = 20;
          contact.gender = contact.FEMALE;
          contact.address = "unknown";
          msg->address_book.push_back(contact);
        }

        std::cout << "Publishing address book:" << std::endl;
        for (auto contact : msg->address_book) {
          std::cout << "First:" << contact.first_name << "  Last:" << contact.last_name <<
            std::endl;
        }

        address_book_publisher_->publish(msg);
      };
    timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(1s, publish_msg);
  }

private:
  rclcpp::Publisher<rosidl_tutorials::msg::AddressBook>::SharedPtr address_book_publisher_;
  rclcpp::timer::TimerBase::SharedPtr timer_;
};


int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
  rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
  auto publisher_node = std::make_shared<AddressBookPublisher>();

  rclcpp::spin(publisher_node);

  return 0;
}
```

### The code explained
```c++
#include "rosidl_tutorials/msg/address_book.hpp"
```
We include the header of our newly created AddressBook msg.
```c++
#include "rosidl_tutorials_msgs/msg/contact.hpp"
```
Here we include the header of the Contact msg in order to be able to add contacts to our address_book.

```c++
using namespace std::chrono_literals;

class AddressBookPublisher : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
  AddressBookPublisher()
  : Node("address_book_publisher")
  {
    address_book_publisher_ =
      this->create_publisher<rosidl_tutorials::msg::AddressBook>("address_book");

```
We create a node and an AddressBook publisher.
```c++
    auto publish_msg = [this]() -> void {
```
We create a callback to publish the messages periodically

```c++
        auto msg = std::make_shared<rosidl_tutorials::msg::AddressBook>();
``` 
We create an AddressBook message instance that we will later publish.

```c++
  {
  rosidl_tutorials_msgs::msg::Contact contact;
  contact.first_name = "John";
  contact.last_name = "Doe";
  contact.age = 30;
  contact.gender = contact.MALE;
  contact.address = "unknown";
  msg->address_book.push_back(person);
  }
  {
  rosidl_tutorials_msgs::msg::Contact person;
  contact.first_name = "Jane";
  contact.last_name = "Doe";
  contact.age = 20;
  contact.gender = contact.FEMALE;
  contact.address = "unknown";
  msg->address_book.push_back(contact);
  }
```
We create and populate Contact messages and add them to our address_book message.
```c++
        std::cout << "Publishing address book:" << std::endl;
        for (auto contact : msg->address_book) {
          std::cout << "First:" << contact.first_name << "  Last:" << contact.last_name <<
            std::endl;
        }

        address_book_publisher_->publish(msg);
```
Finally send the message periodically.

```c++
    timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(1s, publish_msg);
```
Create a 1second timer to call our `publish_msg` function every second

Now let's build it!
We need to create a new target for this node in the `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
add_executable(publish_address_book 
  src/publish_address_book.cpp
)

ament_target_dependencies(publish_address_book
  "rclcpp"
)
```


In order to use the messages generated in the same package we need to use the following cmake code:

```cmake
get_default_rmw_implementation(rmw_implementation)
find_package("${rmw_implementation}" REQUIRED)
get_rmw_typesupport(typesupport_impls "${rmw_implementation}" LANGUAGE "cpp")

foreach(typesupport_impl ${typesupport_impls})
  rosidl_target_interfaces(publish_address_book
    ${PROJECT_NAME} ${typesupport_impl}
  )
endforeach()
```
This finds the relevant generated C++ code from msg/srv and allows your target to link against them.

You may have noticed that this step was not necessary when the interfaces being used were from a package that was built beforehand.
This CMake code is only required when you are trying to use interfaces in the same package as that in which they are built.
