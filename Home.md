# ROS 2

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.
From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project.
And it's all open source.

Here you will find documentation on how to install and use software from **ROS 2**, which is a new version of ROS that is under heavy development.
See below for more information on ROS 2.

If you're looking for information on ROS 1 (i.e., ROS as it has existed for several years and what you might be using right now), check the [ROS website](http://www.ros.org) or the [documentation wiki](http://wiki.ros.org).

**Before you proceed here, please read the [[features page|Features]] to get an idea of what is in the current ROS 2 release.**

## Installation
See [[the installation page|Installation]].

## Tutorials
ROS 2 is under heavy development and all releases are currently "alpha"-prefixed.
You should not expect to switch from ROS 1 to ROS 2 today, but you can check out the [[the tutorials page|Tutorials]] page to see a range of examples of what the system can do in its current state.

## Contributing
See [[the contributing page|Contributing]] and [[the developer guide|Developer-Guide]] for details on how to contribute to ROS 2 developments.

# About ROS 2
Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community.
The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isnâ€™t.
There's a full article on the motivation of ROS 2 [here](http://design.ros2.org/articles/why_ros2.html).

## Current status
Alpha releases for ROS 2 are currently being made on a ~6 week cadence to give community members an opportunity to provide feedback on the system.
At a high level, ROS 2 development has widely focused on laying the groundwork for supporting multiple DDS middleware implementations, multiple operating systems, multiple programming languages and co-existence with systems running ROS 1.
For details of the current features, see [[Features]].


## What's ahead
See the [[Roadmap]] for details on the planned upcoming features for ROS 2.

## Where to find more information
There are various articles on the design of ROS 2 at [design.ros2.org](http://design.ros2.org), such as: [_Why ROS 2.0?_](http://design.ros2.org/articles/why_ros2.html), [_ROS on DDS_](http://design.ros2.org/articles/ros_on_dds.html), and [_Changes between ROS 1 and ROS 2_](http://design.ros2.org/articles/changes.html).

The code for ROS 2 is open source and broken into various repositories. You can find the code for most of the repositories on the [ros2 github organization](https://github.com/ros2).

[docs.ros2.org/beta2](http://docs.ros2.org/beta2/index.html#) contains current, as of Beta 2, details about ROS 2 internal design and organisation.

The following [ROSCon](http://roscon.ros.org) talks have been given on ROS 2 and provide information about the workings of ROS 2 and various demos:
