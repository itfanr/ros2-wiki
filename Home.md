# ROS 2

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.
From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project.
And it's all open source.

Here you will find documentation on how to install and use software from **ROS 2**, which is a new version of ROS that is under heavy development.

If you're looking for information on ROS 1 (i.e., ROS as it has existed for several years and what you might be using right now), check the [ROS website](http://www.ros.org) or the [documentation wiki](http://wiki.ros.org).

**Before you proceed here, please read the [[release overview|Alpha6-Overview]] to get an idea of what is (and is not) in the current ROS 2 release.**
