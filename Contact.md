# Contact us
If you try out ROS 2 and have feedback or questions, please get in touch with us.

Discussions about ROS 2 development and plans are happening on the [sig-ng-ros (Special Interest Group on Next-Generation ROS) mailing list] (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ros-sig-ng-ros).
Join us there and participate in the conversation.

If you identify bugs or feature requests, feel free to open an issue in the appropriate repository tracker. If it's not clear which tracker to use for a particular issue, file it in the [ros2/ros2 repository](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues) and we'll have a look at it. Pull requests are welcome for any of the ros2 repositories!

When filling an issue, please make sure to:

* Include enough information for another person to understand the issue.
* Include information about the exact platform, software, versions, and environment relevant to the problem.
* In case of a bug consider providing a [short, self contained, correct (compilable), example](http://sscce.org/).
