# ROS 2 Pre-Alpha Release (Aug/Sep 2015)

Welcome to the first release of ROS 2 software.  We hope that you try it
out and provide feedback.

## Contacting us

Discussions about ROS 2 development and plans are happening on the
[sig-ng-ros (Special Interest Group on Next-Generation ROS) mailing list]
(https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ros-sig-ng-ros).  Join
us there and participate in the conversation.

If you identify bugs or feature requests, feel free to open an issue in the
appropriate repository tracker.  If it's not clear which tracker to use for
a particular issue, file it in the [ros2/ros2
repository](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues) and we'll have a look at
it.  Pull requests are welcome for any of the ros2 repositories!
