# Contributing to ROS 2


There are a number of ways you can contribute to the ROS 2 project.


## Design discussions


Discussions about the design of ROS 2 are ongoing on the [ROS 2 forum](http://discourse.ros.org/c/ng-ros).
Participating in these discussions is an important way to have a say on the direction of project.


The diverse community behind the ROS ecosystem is one of its greatest assets.
We encourage all members of the ROS community to participate in these design discussions so that we can 1) leverage the experience of community members and 2) keep the varied use cases of ROS in mind.

## Support


One of the easiest ways that you can contribute to ROS 2 is by helping other community members troubleshoot their system.
ROS 2 users come from a range of technical backgrounds, use a variety of different operating systems/platforms, and don’t necessarily have any prior experience with ROS (1 or 2). 


If you see an issue on the [ROS 2 forum](http://discourse.ros.org/c/ng-ros) that is similar to something you’ve run into yourself, please consider providing some pointers to what helped in your situation.
Don’t worry if you are not sure if your response is correct - simply say so and other community members will jump in if necessary.


## Contributing code


### Setting up your development environment


To get started, you'll want to install from source; follow [[the source installation instructions|Installation#building-from-source]] for your platform.


### What to work on


We have identified a number of tasks that could be worked on by community members: they can be listed by [searching across the ROS 2 repositories for issues labeled as "unclaimed"](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aament+user%3Aros2+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunclaimed&type=Issues&ref=searchresults) or filtering the items on [the ROS 2 waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/ros2/ros2?search=unclaimed).
The issues labeled with "experience/beginner" are those that will be the most accessible entry points for people who are new to the code base.
If you see something on that list that you would like to work on, please comment on the item to let others know that you are working on it.


If you have some code to contribute that fixes a bug or improves documentation, please submit it as a pull request to the relevant repository.
For larger changes, it is a good idea to discuss the proposal [here](http://discourse.ros.org/c/ng-ros) before you start to work on it so that you can identify if someone else is already working on something similar.
If your proposal involves changes to the APIs, it is especially recommended that you discuss the approach before starting work.


### Submitting your code changes

Code contributions should be made via pull requests to the [the appropriate ros2 repositories](https://github.com/ros2).

We ask all contributors to follow the practices explained in the [[the developer guide|Developer-Guide]].
