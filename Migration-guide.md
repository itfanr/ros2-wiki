# Migration guide from ROS 1

This article describes the high-level steps to migrate a ROS 1 package to ROS 2.
It does not aim to be a step-by-step migration instruction and is not considered the *final* "solution".
Future versions will aim to make migration smoother and less effort up to the point that maintaining a single package from the same branch for ROS 1 as well as ROS 2

## Prerequisite

Before being able to migrate a ROS 1 package to ROS 2 all of its dependencies must be available in ROS 2.

## Migration steps

### Package manifests

ROS 2 only support the format 2 of the package specification which is defined in [REP 140](http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0140.html).
Therefore the `package.xml` file must be update to format 2 if it uses format 1.
Since ROS 1 support both formats (1 as well as 2) it is safe to perform that conversion in the ROS 1 package.

Some packages might have different names in ROS 2 so the dependencies might need to be updated accordingly.

### Message and service definitions

Message files must end in `.msg` and must be located in the subfolder `msg`.
Service files must end in `.srv` and must be located in the subfolder `srv`.

These files might need to be updated to comply with the [ROS Interface definition](http://design.ros2.org/articles/interface_definition.html).
Some primitive types have been removed and the types `duration` and `time` which were builtin types in ROS 1 have been replaced with normal message definitions and must be used from the [`builtin_interfaces`](https://github.com/ros2/rcl_interfaces/tree/master/builtin_interfaces) package.
Also some naming conventions are stricter then in ROS 1.

In your `package.xml` you will need to add:

- `<buildtool_depend>rosidl_default_generators</buildtool_depend>`
- `<exec_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</exec_depend>`
- For each dependent message package add `<depend>message_package</depend>`

In your `CMakeLists.txt`:

Start by enabling C++11

``` cmake
if(NOT WIN32)
  add_definitions(-std=c++11)
endif()
```

- `find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)`
- For each dependent message package add `find_package(message_package REQUIRED)` and replace the cmake function call to `generate_messages` with `rosidl_generate_interfaces`

This will replace `add_message_files` and `add_service_files` listing of all the message and service files, which can be removed.

### Build system

The build system in ROS 2 is called [ament](http://design.ros2.org/articles/ament.html).

#### Build tool

Instead of using `catkin_make`, `catkin_make_isolated` or `catkin build` ROS 2 uses the command line tool [ament build](https://github.com/ament/ament_tools) to build and install a set of packages.

#### Pure Python package

If the ROS 1 package uses CMake only to invoke the `setup.py` file and does not contain anything beside Python code (e.g. also no messages, services, etc.) it should be converted into a pure Python package in ROS 2:

- Update or add the build type in the `package.xml` file:

  ``` xml
  <export>
    <build_type>ament_python</build_type>
  </export>
  ```

- Remove the `CMakeLists.txt` file

- Update the `setup.py` file to be a standard Python setup script

ROS 2 supports Python 3 only.
While each package can choose to also support Python 2 it must invoke executables with Python 3 if it uses any API provided by other ROS 2 packages.

#### Update the *CMakeLists.txt* to use *ament_cmake*

Apply the following changes to use `ament_cmake` instead of `catkin`:

- Set the build type in the `package.xml` file export section:

  ``` xml
  <export>
    <build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>
  </export>
  ```

- Replace the `find_package` invocation with `catkin` and the `COMPONENTS` with:

  ``` cmake
  find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
  find_package(component1 REQUIRED)
  ...
  find_package(componentN REQUIRED)
  ```

- Move and update the `catkin_package` invocation with:

  - Invoke `ament_package` instead but **after** all targets have been registered.

  - The only valid argument for [ament_package](https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/blob/master/ament_cmake_core/cmake/core/ament_package.cmake) is `CONFIG_EXTRAS`.
    All other arguments are covered by separate functions which all need to be invoked *before* `ament_package`.

  - **TODO document ament_export_interfaces?**

- Replace the invocation of `add_message_files`, `add_service_files` and `generate_messages` with [rosidl_generate_interfaces](https://github.com/ros2/rosidl/blob/master/rosidl_cmake/cmake/rosidl_generate_interfaces.cmake).

  - The first argument is the `target_name`.
    If you're building just one library it's `${PROJECT_NAME}`

  - Followed by the list of message filenames, relative to the package root.

    - If you will be using the list of filenames multiple times, it is recommended to compose a list of message files and pass the list to the function for clarity.

  - The final multi-value-keyword argument fpr `generate_messages` is `DEPENDENCIES` which requires the list of dependent message packages.

    ``` cmake
    rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
      ${msg_files}
      DEPENDENCIES std_msgs
    )
    ```

- Remove any occurrences of the *devel space*.
  Related CMake variables like `CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX` do not exist anymore.

  - The `CATKIN_DEPENDS` and `DEPENDS` arguments are passed to the new function [ament_export_dependencies](https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/blob/master/ament_cmake_export_dependencies/cmake/ament_export_dependencies.cmake).

- Replace the invocation of `add_message_files`, `add_service_files` and `generate_messages` with [rosidl_generate_interfaces](https://github.com/ros2/rosidl/blob/master/rosidl_cmake/cmake/rosidl_generate_interfaces.cmake).

- Remove any occurrences of the *devel space*.
  Related CMake variables like `CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX` do not exist anymore.

  - `CATKIN_GLOBAL_BIN_DESTINATION`: `bin`
  - `CATKIN_GLOBAL_INCLUDE_DESTINATION`: `include`
  - `CATKIN_GLOBAL_LIB_DESTINATION`: `lib`
  - `CATKIN_GLOBAL_LIBEXEC_DESTINATION`: `lib`
  - `CATKIN_GLOBAL_SHARE_DESTINATION`: `share`
  - `CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION`: `lib/${PROJECT_NAME}`
  - `CATKIN_PACKAGE_INCLUDE_DESTINATION`: `include/${PROJECT_NAME}`
  - `CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION`: `lib`
  - `CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION`: `share/${PROJECT_NAME}`

#### Unit tests

If you are using gtest

- replace `CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING` with `BUILD_TESTING` (until alpha 5 this was `AMENT_ENABLE_TESTING`)
- replace `catkin_add_gtest` with `ament_add_gtest`
- add a `<test_depend>ament_cmake_gtest</test_depend>`

##### Linters

In ROS 2.0 we are working to maintain clean code using linters.
The styles for different languages are defined in our [Developer Guide](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Developer-Guide).

If you are starting a project from scratch it is recommended to follow the style guide and turn on the automatic linter unittests by adding these lines just below `if(BUILD_TESTING)` (until alpha 5 this was `AMENT_ENABLE_TESTING`)

``` cmake
find_package(ament_lint_auto REQUIRED)
ament_lint_auto_find_test_dependencies()
```

You will also need to add the following dependencies to your `package.xml`:

``` xml
<test_depend>ament_lint_auto</test_depend>
<test_depend>ament_lint_common</test_depend>
```

#### Continue to use `catkin` in CMake

ROS 2 uses ament as the build system but for backward compatibility ROS 2 has a package called `catkin` which provides almost the same API as catkin in ROS 1.
In order to use this backward compatibility API the `CMakeLists.txt` must only be updated to call the function `catkin_ament_package()` *after* all targets.

**NOTE: This has not been implemented yet and is only an idea at the moment.
Due to the amount of changes related to dependencies it has not yet been decided if this compatibility API is useful enough to justify the effort.**

### Update source code

#### Messages and services

The namespace of ROS 2 messages and services uses a subnamespace (`msg` or `srv`) after the package name.
Therefore an include looks like: `#include <my_interfaces/msg/my_message.hpp>`.
The C++ type is then named: `my_interfaces::msg::MyMessage`.

Shared pointer types are provided as typedefs within the message structs: `my_interfaces::msg::MyMessage::SharedPtr` as well as `my_interfaces::msg::MyMessage::ConstSharedPtr`.

For more details please see the article about the [generated C++ interfaces](http://design.ros2.org/articles/generated_interfaces_cpp.html).

The migration requires includes to change by:

- insert the subfolder `msg` between the package name and message datatype
- Change the included filename from CamelCase to underscore separation
- Change from `*.h` to `*.hpp`

``` cpp
// ROS 1 style is in comments, ROS 2 follows, uncommented.
// # include <geometry_msgs/PointStamped.h>
#include <geometry_msgs/msg/point_stamped.hpp>

// geometry_msgs::PointStamped point_stamped;
geometry_msgs::msg::PointStamped point_stamped;
```

The migration requires code to insert the `msg` namespace into all instances.

#### Use of service objects
Service callbacks in ROS 2 do not have boolean return values.
Instead of returning false on failures, throwing exceptions is recommended.

``` cpp
// ROS 1 style is in comments, ROS 2 follows, uncommented.
// #include "nav_msgs/GetMap.h"
#include "nav_msgs/srv/get_map.hpp"

// bool service_callback(
//   nav_msgs::GetMap::Request & request,
//   nav_msgs::GetMap::Response & response)
void service_callback(
  const std::shared_ptr<nav_msgs::srv::GetMap::Request> request,
  std::shared_ptr<nav_msgs::srv::GetMap::Response> response)
{
  // ...
  // return true;  // or false for failure
}
```

#### Usages of ros::Time

**TODO There is no direct replacement for ros::Time yet we expect to have one in the future.**

Under the hood we expect to leverage the cross platform `std::chrono` library.

Currently for usages of `ros::Time`:

- replace all instances of `ros::Time` with `builtin_interfaces::msg::Time`
- Convert all instances of `nsec` to `nanosec`
- Convert all single argument double constructors to bare constructor + assignment

Field values do not get initialized to zero when constructed.
You must make sure to set all values instead of relying on them to be zero.

Alternatively you can switch to an internal proxy datatype temporarily while waiting for an rclcpp::Time

#### Usages of ros::Rate

There is an equivalent type `rclcpp::rate::Rate` object which is basically a drop in replacement for `ros::Rate`.

#### ROS client library

**NOTE: to be written**

#### Boost

Much of the functionality previously provided by Boost has been integrated into C++11.
As such we would like to take advantage of the new core features and avoid the dependency on boost where possible.

##### Shared Pointers

To switch shared pointers from boost to C++11 replace instances of:

- `#include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>` with `<memory>`
- `boost::shared_ptr` with `std::shared_ptr`

There may also be variants such as `weak_ptr` which you want to convert as well.

Also it is recommended practice to use `using` instead of `typedef`.
`using` has the ability to work better in templated logic.
For details [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10747810/what-is-the-difference-between-typedef-and-using-in-c11)

##### Thread/Mutexes

Another common part of boost used in ROS codebases are mutexes in `boost::thread`.

- Replace `boost::mutex::scoped_lock` with `std::unique_lock<std::mutex>`
- Replace `boost::mutex` with `std::mutex`
- Replace `#include <boost/thread/mutex.hpp>` with `#include <mutex>`

##### Unordered Map

Replace:

- `#include <boost/unordered_map.hpp>` with `#include <unordered_map>`
- `boost::unordered_map` with `std::unordered_map`

##### function

Replace:

- `#include <boost/function.hpp>`  with `#include <functional>`
- `boost::function` with `std::function`

## Launch files

While launch files in ROS 1 are specified using [.xml](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML) files ROS 2 uses Python scripts to enable more flexibility (see [launch package](https://github.com/ros2/launch/tree/master/launch)).

## Example: Converting an existing ROS 1 package to use ROS 2

Let's say that we have simple ROS 1 package called `talker` that uses `roscpp`
in one node, called `talker`.
This package is in a catkin workspace, located at `~/ros1_talker`.

### The ROS 1 code

Here's the directory layout of our catkin workspace:

``` bash
$ cd ~/ros1_talker
$ find .
.
./src
./src/talker
./src/talker/package.xml
./src/talker/CMakeLists.txt
./src/talker/talker.cpp
```

Here is the content of those three files:

`src/talker/package.xml`:

``` xml
<package>
  <name>talker</name>
  <version>0.0.0</version>
  <description>talker</description>
  <maintainer email="gerkey@osrfoundation.org">Brian Gerkey</maintainer>
  <license>Apache 2.0</license>
  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>
  <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
  <build_depend>std_msgs</build_depend>
  <run_depend>roscpp</run_depend>
  <run_depend>std_msgs</run_depend>
</package>
```

`src/talker/CMakeLists.txt`:

``` cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(talker)
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp std_msgs)
catkin_package()
include_directories(${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(talker talker.cpp)
target_link_libraries(talker ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
install(TARGETS talker
  RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION})
```

`src/talker/talker.cpp`:

``` cpp
#include <sstream>
#include "ros/ros.h"
#include "std_msgs/String.h"
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  ros::init(argc, argv, "talker");
  ros::NodeHandle n;
  ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>("chatter", 1000);
  ros::Rate loop_rate(10);
  int count = 0;
  std_msgs::String msg;
  while (ros::ok())
  {
    std::stringstream ss;
    ss << "hello world " << count++;
    msg.data = ss.str();
    ROS_INFO("%s", msg.data.c_str());
    chatter_pub.publish(msg);
    ros::spinOnce();
    loop_rate.sleep();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

#### Building the ROS 1 code

We source an environment setup file (in this case for Jade using bash), then we
build our package using `catkin_make install`:

``` bash
. /opt/ros/jade/setup.bash
cd ~/ros1_talker
catkin_make install
```

#### Running the ROS 1 node

If there's not already one running, we start a `roscore`, first sourcing the
setup file from our `catkin` install tree (the system setup file at
`/opt/ros/jade/setup.bash` would also work here):

``` bash
. ~/ros1_talker/install/setup.bash
roscore
```

In another shell, we run the node from the `catkin` install space using
`rosrun`, again sourcing the setup file first (in this case it must be the one
from our workspace):

``` bash
. ~/ros1_talker/install/setup.bash
rosrun talker talker
```

### Migrating to ROS 2

Let's start by creating a new workspace in which to work:

``` bash
mkdir ~/ros2_talker
cd ~/ros2_talker
```

We'll copy the source tree from our ROS 1 package into that workspace, where we can modify it:

``` bash
mkdir src
cp -a ~/ros1_talker/src/talker src
```

Now we'll modify the the C++ code in the node.
The ROS 2 C++ library, called `rclcpp`, provides a different API from that
provided by `roscpp`.
The concepts are very similar between the two libraries, which makes the changes
reasonably straightforward to make.

#### Included headers

In place of `ros/ros.h`, which gave us access to the `roscpp` library API, we
need to include `rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp`, which gives us access to the `rclcpp`
library API:

``` cpp
//#include "ros/ros.h"
#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
```

To get the `std_msgs/String` message definition, in place of
`std_msgs/String.h`, we need to include `std_msgs/msg/string.hpp`:

``` cpp
//#include "std_msgs/String.h"
#include "std_msgs/msg/string.hpp"
```

#### Changing C++ library calls

Instead of passing the node's name to the library initialization call, we do
the initialization, then pass the node name to the creation of the node object
(we can use the `auto` keyword because now we're requiring a C++11 compiler):

``` cpp
//  ros::init(argc, argv, "talker");
//  ros::NodeHandle n;
    rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
    auto node = rclcpp::node::Node::make_shared("talker");
```

The creation of the publisher and rate objects looks pretty similar, with some
changes to the names of namespace and methods.
For the publisher, instead of an integer queue length argument, we pass a
quality of service (qos) profile, which is a far more flexible way to
controlling how message delivery is handled.
In this example, we just pass the default profile `rmw_qos_profile_default`
(it's global because it's declared in `rmw`, which is written in C and so
doesn't have namespaces).

``` cpp
//  ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>("chatter", 1000);
//  ros::Rate loop_rate(10);
  auto chatter_pub = node->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>("chatter",
    rmw_qos_profile_default);
  rclcpp::rate::Rate loop_rate(10);
```

The creation of the outgoing message is different in both the namespace and the
fact that we go ahead and create a shared pointer (this may change in the future
with more publish API that accepts const references):

``` cpp
//  std_msgs::String msg;
  auto msg = std::make_shared<std_msgs::msg::String>();
```

In place of `ros::ok()`, we call `rclcpp::ok()`:

``` cpp
//  while (ros::ok())
  while (rclcpp::ok())
```

Inside the publishing loop, we use the `->` operator to access the `data` field
(because now `msg` is a shared pointer):

``` cpp
//    msg.data = ss.str();
    msg->data = ss.str();
```

To print a console message, instead of using `ROS_INFO()`, we use `printf()`
(this is temporary, because we don't yet have an equivalent of the `rosconsole`
package):

``` cpp
//    ROS_INFO("%s", msg.data.c_str());
    printf("%s\n", msg->data.c_str());
```

Publishing the message is very similar, the only noticeable difference being
that the publisher is now a shared pointer:

``` cpp
//    chatter_pub.publish(msg);
    chatter_pub->publish(msg);
```

Spinning (i.e., letting the communications system process any pending
incoming/outgoing messages) is different in that the call now takes the node as
an argument:

``` cpp
//    ros::spinOnce();
    rclcpp::spin_some(node);
```

Sleeping using the rate object is unchanged.

Putting it all together, the new `talker.cpp` looks like this:

``` cpp
#include <sstream>
// #include "ros/ros.h"
#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
// #include "std_msgs/String.h"
#include "std_msgs/msg/string.hpp"
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
//  ros::init(argc, argv, "talker");
//  ros::NodeHandle n;
  rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
  auto node = rclcpp::node::Node::make_shared("talker");
//  ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>("chatter", 1000);
//  ros::Rate loop_rate(10);
  auto chatter_pub = node->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>("chatter", rmw_qos_profile_default);
  rclcpp::rate::Rate loop_rate(10);
  int count = 0;
//  std_msgs::String msg;
  auto msg = std::make_shared<std_msgs::msg::String>();
//  while (ros::ok())
  while (rclcpp::ok())
  {
    std::stringstream ss;
    ss << "hello world " << count++;
//    msg.data = ss.str();
    msg->data = ss.str();
//    ROS_INFO("%s", msg.data.c_str());
    printf("%s\n", msg->data.c_str());
//    chatter_pub.publish(msg);
    chatter_pub->publish(msg);
//    ros::spinOnce();
    rclcpp::spin_some(node);
    loop_rate.sleep();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

#### Changing the `package.xml`

Starting with ROS 2, only version 2 of the `package.xml` format is supported
(this format is also supported in ROS 1, but isn't used by all packages).
We start by specifying the format version in the `package` tag:

``` xml
<!-- <package> -->
<package format="2">
```

ROS 2 uses a newer version of `catkin`, called `ament`, which we specify in the
`buildtool_depend` tag:

``` xml
<!--  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend> -->
  <buildtool_depend>ament_cmake</buildtool_depend>
```

In our build dependencies, instead of `roscpp` we use `rclcpp`, which provides
the C++ API that we use.
We additionally depend on `rmw_implementation`, which pulls in the default
implementation of the `rmw` abstraction layer that allows us to support multiple
DDS implementations (we should consider restructuring / renaming things so that
it's possible to depend on one thing, analogous to `roscpp`):

``` xml
<!--  <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend> -->
  <build_depend>rclcpp</build_depend>
  <build_depend>rmw_implementation</build_depend>
```

We make the same addition in the run dependencies and also update from the
`run_depend` tag to the `exec_depend` tag (part of the upgrade to version 2 of
the package format):

``` xml
<!--  <run_depend>roscpp</run_depend> -->
  <exec_depend>rclcpp</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>rmw_implementation</exec_depend>
<!--  <run_depend>std_msgs</run_depend> -->
  <exec_depend>std_msgs</exec_depend>
```

We also need to tell `ament` what *kind* of package we are, so that it knows how
to build us.
Because we're using `ament` and CMake, we add the following lines to declare our
build type to be `ament_cmake`:

``` xml
  <export>
    <build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>
  </export>
```

Putting it all together, our `package.xml` now looks like this:

``` xml
<!-- <package> -->
<package format="2">
  <name>talker</name>
  <version>0.0.0</version>
  <description>talker</description>
  <maintainer email="gerkey@osrfoundation.org">Brian Gerkey</maintainer>
  <license>Apache License 2.0</license>
<!--  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend> -->
  <buildtool_depend>ament_cmake</buildtool_depend>
<!--  <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend> -->
  <build_depend>rclcpp</build_depend>
  <build_depend>rmw_implementation</build_depend>
  <build_depend>std_msgs</build_depend>
<!--  <run_depend>roscpp</run_depend> -->
  <exec_depend>rclcpp</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>rmw_implementation</exec_depend>
<!--  <run_depend>std_msgs</run_depend> -->
  <exec_depend>std_msgs</exec_depend>
  <export>
    <build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>
  </export>
</package>
```

**TODO: show simpler version of this file just using the `<depend>` tag, which is
enabled by version 2 of the package format (also supported in `catkin` so,
strictly speaking, orthogonal to ROS 2).**

#### Changing the CMake code

ROS 2 relies on the C++11 standard.
Depending on what compiler you're using, support for C++11 might not be enabled
by default.
Using `gcc` 5.3 (which is what is used on Ubuntu Xenial), we need to enable it
explicitly, which we do by adding this line near the top of the file:

``` cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")
```

Using `catkin`, we specify the packages we want to build against by passing them
as `COMPONENTS` arguments when initially finding `catkin` itself.
With `ament`, we find each package individually, starting with `ament_cmake`
(and adding our new dependency, `rmw_implementation`):

``` cmake
#find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp std_msgs)
find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(rmw_implementation REQUIRED)
find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED)
```

We call `catkin_package()` to auto-generate things like CMake configuration
files for other packages that use our package.
Whereas that call happens *before* specifying targets to build, we now call the
analogous `ament_package()` *after* the targets:

``` cmake
# catkin_package()
# At the bottom of the file:
ament_package()
```

Similarly to how we found each dependent package separately, instead of finding
them as parts of catkin, we also need to add their include directories
separately (see also `ament_target_dependencies()` below, which is a more
concise and more thorough way of handling dependent packages' build flags):

``` cmake
#include_directories(${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})
include_directories(${rclcpp_INCLUDE_DIRS}
                    ${rmw_implementation_INCLUDE_DIRS}
                    ${std_msgs_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

We do the same to link against our dependent packages' libraries:

``` cmake
#target_link_libraries(talker ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
target_link_libraries(talker
                      ${rclcpp_LIBRARIES}
                      ${rmw_implementation_LIBRARIES}
                      ${std_msgs_LIBRARIES})
```

**TODO: explain how `ament_target_dependencies()` simplifies the above steps and
is also better (also handling `*_DEFINITIONS`, doing target-specific include
directories, etc.).**

For installation, `catkin` defines variables like
`CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION`.
With `ament`, we just give a path relative to the installation root, like `bin`
for executables (this is in part because we don't yet have an equivalent of
`rosrun`):

``` cmake
#install(TARGETS talker
#  RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION})
install(TARGETS talker RUNTIME DESTINATION bin)
```

Putting it all together, the new `CMakeLists.txt` looks like this:

``` cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(talker)
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")
#find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp std_msgs)
find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(rmw_implementation REQUIRED)
find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED)
#catkin_package()
#include_directories(${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})
include_directories(${rclcpp_INCLUDE_DIRS}
                    ${rmw_implementation_INCLUDE_DIRS}
                    ${std_msgs_INCLUDE_DIRS})

**TODO: Show what this would look like with `ament_auto`.**

#### Building the ROS 2 code

We source an environment setup file (in this case the one generated by following
the ROS 2 installation tutorial, which builds in `~/ros2_ws`, then we build our
package using `ament build`:

``` bash
. ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
cd ~/ros2_talker
ament build
```

#### Running the ROS 2 node

Because we installed the `talker` executable into `bin`, after sourcing the
setup file, from our `ament` install tree, we can invoke it by name directly
(also, there is not yet a ROS 2 equivalent for `rosrun`):

``` bash
. ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
talker
```
