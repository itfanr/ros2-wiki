# ROS 2 alpha5 release <br\> (code name *Epoxy*; April 2016)

Welcome to the latest release of ROS 2 software!  We hope that you try it out and [provide feedback](#contact-us).

## Scope

As the "alpha" qualifier suggests, this release of ROS 2 is far from
complete.
You should not expect to switch from ROS 1 to ROS 2, nor should
you expect to build a new robot control system with ROS 2.
Rather, you
should expect to try out some demos, explore the code, and perhaps write
your own demos.

The major features included in this release are:

- Support for C data structures in Fast and Connext Dynamic rmw implementations.
- Support services in C.
- Added 32-bit and 64-bit ARM as experimentally supported platforms.

Pretty much anything not listed above is not included in this release.
The next steps are described in the [[Roadmap]].
