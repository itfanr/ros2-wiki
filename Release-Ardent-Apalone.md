### ROS 2 Ardent Apalone (codename 'ardent'; December 2017)

Welcome to the first non-beta release of ROS 2 software named *Ardent Apalone*!

### Supported Platforms

This version of ROS 2 is supported on three platforms:
- Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)
- Mac OS X 10.12 (Sierra)
- Windows 10

Binary packages as well as instructions for how to compile from source are provided for all 3 platforms (see [install instructions](Installation.md) as well as [documentation](http://docs.ros2.org/ardent/)).

### Features

- Distributed discovery, publish / subscribe, request / response communication
  - Provided by a C API
  - Implemented using different vendors:
    - eProsima's FastRTPS as well as ADLINK's OpenSplice (from binary and source)
    - RTI's Connext (only from source)
  - Numerous quality of service settings for handling non-ideal networks
  - DDS Security support (with Connext and FastRTPS)
- C++ and Python 3 client libraries
  - Sharing common code in C to unify the implementation
  - Execution model separated from the nodes, composable nodes
  - Node-specific parameters (only in C++ atm)
  - Life cycle (only in C++ atm)
  - Optionally intra-process communication using the same API (only in C++)
- Message definitions (with bounded arrays and strings as well as default values)
- Command line tools (e.g. `ros2 run`)
- `rviz` with a few display types (the Windows version will likely follow in a few weeks)
- File system-based resource index (querying information without recursive crawling)
- Realtime safe code paths for pub / sub (with compatible DDS implementations only)
- Bridge between ROS 1 and ROS 2
- HSR demo [see Beta 3](Beta3-Overview)
- Turtlebot demo [see Beta 2](Beta2-Overview)

For a more detailed description please see the [Features](Features.md) page.

#### Changes since Beta 3 release

Improvements since the Beta 3 release:
- `rviz`
- Different initialization options for message data structures in C++ (see [design doc](http://design.ros2.org/articles/generated_interfaces_cpp.html#constructors))
- Logging API improvements, now also used in the demos
- Time support in C++ with different clocks
- wait-for-service support in the Python client library
- Draft implementation of [REP 149](http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0149.html) specifying format 3 of the package manifest files

### Known Issues
* FastRTPS performance with larger data like the image demo
* Using Connext it is currently not allowed for two topics with the same base name but different namespaces to have a different type (see [issue](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_connext/issues/234)).
* Listing of node names (e.g. using `ros2 node list`) does not work across some rmw implementations.
* On Windows Python launch files might hang when trying to abort using `Ctrl-C` (see [issue](https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/64)). In order to continue using the shell which is blocked by the hanging command you might want to end the hanging Python process using the process monitor.
