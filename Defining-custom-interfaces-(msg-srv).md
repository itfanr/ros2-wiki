# Defining custom interfaces (msg/srv)

**INCOMPLETE**

While we encourage reuse of existing "standard" message and service definitions wherever possible, there are plenty of cases in which you'll need to define your own custom messages and/or services for a particular application.
The first step in defining a custom message or service is to write the `.msg` or `.srv` file, which you do using the [ROS interface definition language](About-ROS-Interfaces).
By convention, `.msg` files go into a package subdirectory called `msg` and `.srv` files go into a package subdirectory called `srv` (you can pick different locations, but we recommend following the convention).

Having written your `.msg` and/or `.srv` files, you need to add some code to your package's `CMakelists.txt` file to make the code generators run over your definitions. In lieu of a more complete tutorial on this topic, consult the [pendulum_msgs package](https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/master/pendulum_msgs) as an example. You can see the relevant CMake calls in that packages's [CMakeLists.txt file](https://github.com/ros2/demos/blob/master/pendulum_msgs/CMakeLists.txt).
