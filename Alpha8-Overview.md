# ROS 2 alpha8 release <br\> (code name *Hook-and-Loop*; October 2016)

Welcome to the latest release of ROS 2 software!  We hope that you try it out and [provide feedback](#contact-us).

## New version of Ubuntu required

Until Alpha 6 ROS 2 was targeting Ubuntu Trusty Tahr (14.04). As of Alpha 7 ROS 2 is targeting Ubuntu Xenial Xerus (16.04) to benefit from newer versions of the compiler, CMake, Python, etc.

## Scope

As the "alpha" qualifier suggests, this release of ROS 2 is far from complete.
You should not expect to switch from ROS 1 to ROS 2, nor should you expect to build a new robot control system with ROS 2.
Rather, you should expect to try out some demos, explore the code, and perhaps write your own demos.

The improvements included in this release are:

- Several improvements to FastRTPS and its rmw implementation
- Switched to FastRTPS as the default rmw implementation
- Added QoS support in rclpy
- Fixed various bugs with the previous alpha release

Pretty much anything not listed above is not included in this release.
The next steps are described in the [[Roadmap]].
